SPHSC 525 Final Project
Robert Gale

VowelMaker uses a training set of recorded vowels to produce crude
speech synthesis. Features availabe in the GUI include selectable model
configuration, spectral envelope plots, adjustable frequency and length,
and twelve exciting vowels!

All the vowel data is available at 
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~hillenbr/voweldata.html . You'll need 
men.zip, women.zip, and children.zip. Simply uncompress and put the wav
files in the data/ directory.

The file to run is VowelMaker.m.
